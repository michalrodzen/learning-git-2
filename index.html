            Once I was seven years old my momma told me, 
            Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
            Once I was seven years old	
        </p>

		It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
		Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
		By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
		Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
